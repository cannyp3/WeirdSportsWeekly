   In March 2020, NBA player Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID-19 after touching multiple microphones during a media availability. This incident led to a significant disruption in the sports world, with the NBA suspending its season and other leagues following suit. The subsequent outbreaks and schedule changes, including the Ravens-Steelers game being postponed multiple times, added to the bizarre nature of the situation.

   During Game 6 of the 2020 World Series, Los Angeles Dodgers star Justin Turner tested positive for COVID-19 but continued to play. After the game, he celebrated without wearing a mask, which was a shocking display of poor decision-making amidst the pandemic.

3. **Novak Djokovic's Disqualification from the U.S. Open**:
