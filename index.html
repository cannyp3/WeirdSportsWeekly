1. **Rudy Gobert's COVID-19 Test and the Subsequent Sports World Shutdown**:
   In March 2020, Rudy Gobert, a Utah Jazz player, touched every microphone and recording device during a media availability session, seemingly mocking the public's concern about COVID-19. Two days later, he tested positive for the virus, becoming the first NBA player to do so. This led to the NBA suspending its season, and other sports leagues followed suit, significantly impacting the sports world.

2. **Justin Turner's Maskless Celebration During the 2020 World Series**:
   During Game 6 of the 2020 World Series, Los Angeles Dodgers star Justin Turner returned an inconclusive COVID-19 test result but took the field anyway. When his positive test result came back, he was removed from the game. Despite this, Turner celebrated with his teammates without wearing a mask, creating a bizarre and shocking display of poor decision-making.

3. **Mike Tyson's Exhibition Boxing Match with Roy Jones Jr.**:
   In November 2020, Mike Tyson and Roy Jones Jr. engaged in an exhibition boxing match that was widely regarded as strange and unnecessary. The match was judged a draw, setting the stage for a rematch that many did not want to see. This event was particularly unusual given Tyson's age and the lack of competitive context.`;
